		<p class="info">Let’s face it, 2020 was  a long and rough year. The pandemic, the lockdown and killer bees? No, thank you. 2020 was not it, but Summer 2021 will be different. A good different.  Like We Used To Festival 2021 is a tribute to the end of the long, chaotic year of 2020. This festival gives people a chance to unwind and go back to their own life-enjoying selves. Come to enjoy comtemporary r&b music from your favorite artists on the lawn of Central Park in NYC. Let’s live life “like we used to”.<br>See you there!<p>
		<p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: Like We Used To  Festival 2021 is a fictional festival, it does not exist.  The idea of this festival is based on the artists I would  like to see perform after lockdown. The line up includes r&b artists who’s music I listened to throughout quaratine and who’s music makes me feel better in times of chaos like during a global pandemic. -Rachel<p>
