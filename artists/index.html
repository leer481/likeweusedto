					<h2 class="title1">frank ocean<h2>
					<div class="info1">Frank Ocean has been one of the more fascinating figures in contemporary music since his early-2010s arrival. A singer and songwriter whose artful output has defied rigid classification as R&B, he has nonetheless pushed that genre forward with seemingly offhanded yet imaginatively detailed narratives in which he has alternated between yearning romantic and easygoing braggart. Known first as a writer and Odd Future affiliate, Ocean made his solo debut with "Novacane" (2011). Channel Orange (2012), his first proper album, nearly crowned the Billboard 200 and made him a Grammy winner. When Ocean left the major-label system, his commercial clout was greater than ever, as demonstrated by the chart-topping success of Blonde (2016).<div></div>

					<h2 class="title3">keshi<h2>
					<div class="info3">Vocalist, instrumentalist, and songwriter Keshi built his infectious tracks out of lo-fi hip-hop beats and ultra-chill R&B vocalizing. His songs were defined by distant falsetto vocals, delicate and textural instrumentals, and booming drums, and singles like 2017's "over u" helped define a particularly gentle subset of R&B. Defined by bittersweet melodies, lamenting lyrics of lost love and wobbly lo-fi hip hop beats, Keshi's first singles in 2017 broke through to millions of listeners. Keshi's music continued to develop, taking on more a more polished sound with 2019's four-song project Skeletons. He has accumulated over 350 million streams with songs such as "like i need u" and "2 soon".<div>
